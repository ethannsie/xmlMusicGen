* Code stores the top 8 that are above 1 standard deviation below the mean of each frame
* Will add blank notes for any below one standard standard deviation

* Uses fluidsynth to generte piano noises
* Fixed matrix to be based on an initial steady state instead of one starting chord
* Graph seems complete for now? But may need to implement a similar method to page rank if I ever find a sink
* Tracks trajectory based on random initial state
* Need to look into more markov things and other ways to tweak this system
* Potentially training onto an artist as opposed to a songs



OVERALL THINGS TO DO
------------------------------
------------------------------
* Figure out how Fast Fourier Transform works
* Figure out good explanations for the sound library I used
* Break down the princeton row stochastic matrix
