* Jeff Heaton Code works
* Figure out how it works with the FFT
* Store the notes from each frame in a database to use for analysis

* brew install ffmpeg
* ffmpeg -i input.mp3 output.wav
* brew install poppler

* Code stores the top 8 that are above 1 standard deviation below the mean of each frame
* Will add blank notes for any below one standard standard deviation

* Uses fluidsynth to generte piano noises
* Fixed matrix to be based on an initial steady state instead of one starting chord
* Graph seems complete for now? But may need to implement a similar method to page rank if I ever find a sink
* Tracks trajectory based on random initial state
* Need to look into more markov things and other ways to tweak this system
* Potentially training onto an artist as opposed to a songs



OVERALL THINGS TO DO
------------------------------
------------------------------
* Figure out how Fast Fourier Transform works
* Figure out good explanations for the sound library I used
* Break down the princeton row stochastic matrix

* All of that is useless.
* FIX THE TOP STAFF

* Current project specs
  * Code takes XML data from Musescore. I can also decompress MusicXML Code
  * This XML data is read through an element tree and returns data from every measure
  * Using that data, I can create a list of nested lists that represent a musical score
  * A score consists of a list where each measure in the score is a list of 64 lists in the big list
  * The XML data is then spread throughout each 64th of a note based on duration and start time read from the XML
  * This allows for transition states between each 64th of a note which should account for both length

* Things to try:
  * Isolating bottom staff and top staff
